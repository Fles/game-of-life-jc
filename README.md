## Game of Life

Inspired by [John Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

Rendering generations based on 4 rules for every cell:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
